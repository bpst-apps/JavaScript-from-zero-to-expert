# Guess My Number Game
The Guess My Number Game is a fun and interactive game that tests the user's guessing skills. The system will generate a random number between 1 and 20, which will be hidden with a '?' sign. The user will then have the opportunity to select a number between 1 and 20, attempting to guess the hidden number.

The number of times the user takes to guess the hidden number will determine their score. The user's score will start at 20 and will decrease by 1 for each attempt they make. This means that the fewer attempts it takes the user to guess the number, the higher their score will be. The user can continue to play the game and make multiple attempts until they successfully guess the hidden number.

Once the user successfully guesses the number, they will be able to see their score and compare it to the highest score across all users' attempts. This will give them a sense of how well they did compared to others who have played the game. The system will keep track of all user scores, allowing the user to see their progress over time and strive to improve their score.

The game is designed to be simple and easy to play, making it suitable for all ages. The user interface is user-friendly and intuitive, allowing the user to quickly select their guess and see the results of their attempts.
